### Tasks
1. Palindrome checker
2. Vowel/consonant counter
3. Arithmetic calculator
4. Area of a circle calculator
5. Even/odd checker
6. Factorial calculator
7. Fibonacci series generator
8. Compound interest calculator

### Task Files
* ðŸš§ C++ - [tasks.cpp](./tasks.cpp)
* ðŸš§ Java - [tasks.java](./tasks.java)
* âœ… Python - [tasks.py](./tasks.py)

_**Disclaimer:** Although the C++ and Java files are currently empty, they should be completed very soon (this README will be updated once they are). In addition, documentation has not been added to the Python file, but it will be included in all three files once they are complete. The current ETA is sometime before 2/1/2022._

### Scoring Rubric

A scoring rubric may or may not be released in the future... for now, all we'll say is that points were allocated very generously based on completion of each step of the process, and partial points were awarded to teams who at least attempted a step, even if they didn't code it correctly. Note that the term "step" in this case refers to any non-trivial steps anywhere in the program, not necessarily a line of code or something within one of the tasks. No points were awarded for portions which were not attempted at all.

### Reflection

Based on the feedback given, these tasks were either very challenging or very easy, but took lots of time to implement. The aim with this competition was to provide lots of opportunity for competitors to earn points from various tasks regardless of what they were skilled at, thus why there are 15 tasks. In addition, the tasks were meant to be of varying levels of difficulty (general increasing as you go down the list). Given the mixed feedback thus far and the great disparity among scores, it is practically impossible to gauge how difficult this set of tasks truly was. It was also very difficult to guess how competitiors felt about each task individually as most teams completed a different set of tasks, except for those such as the Palindrome checker and Arithmetic calculator, which many teams completed.

As feedback to competitors, remember that partial credit is always an opportunity! Many teams barely got past the menu, some only coded a single task and gave up afterwards. Even if you aren't sure about something, at least include it in the menu and parse the input and pass it to a bare function. Along with proper style, documentation, and modularity, this would earn plenty of points, which, especially since almost all teams missed out on points for documentation, helped a lot given how close scores were for those who weren't able to write as much cose.
